This is a demonstration of using Micromonitor capabilities from an
RTEMS application.  

The following files are from umon-1.17:

monlib.c
monlib.h
tfs.h
cli.h

After printing the arguments, it will attempt to cat the contents
of mon_getenv("TFSFS_FILENAME") followed by "csbboot" and "boot"
from the TFS filesystem.
