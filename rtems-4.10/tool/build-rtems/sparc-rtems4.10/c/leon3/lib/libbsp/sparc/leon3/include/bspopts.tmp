/* The leon3 console driver can operate in either polled or interrupt mode.
   Under the simulator (especially when FAST_UART is defined), polled seems to
   operate better. It is common for a task to print a line (like the end of
   test message) and then exit. In this case, the program returns control to
   the simulator command line before the program has even queued the output to
   the uart. Thus sis has no chance of getting the data out. */
